Steps to build and install
==========================

To build and install the application CMake is required (http://www.cmake.org/).

On Ubuntu you'll need packages libqt4-dev, cmake, libxfixes-dev,
libxtst-dev (optional; auto-paste into some applications),
libqtwebkit-dev (optional; advanced HTML rendering).

Build with following commands:

    cmake .
    make

To install run (sudo is required for root privileges on Linux):

    sudo make install
