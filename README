$ copyq

Insert text to the clipboard:
$ copyq add "print([x**2 for x in range(10)])"
and process it in python interpreter:
$ copyq action python
The result will be copied to the clipboard.

For each file in given directory create new item:
$ copyq action "ls /"

File content into clipboard:
$ copyq action "cat file.txt" ""
(last argument is separator - empty means "create single item")

Process an item with the python interpreter and redirect the standard output
to the standard error output using sh command (shell).
Note: Standard error output will be show as tray icon tooltip.
$ copyq add 'print "Hello world!"'
$ copyq action 'sh -c "python 1>&2"'
