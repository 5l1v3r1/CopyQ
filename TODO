[ ] Process command line arguments using QtScript
    (http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/scripting.html)
[ ] Configuration dialog should be separate class
    (not part of the ConfigurationManager)
[ ] Selection lost if scrolling from bottom (Qt bug?)
[ ] Don't save settings while copyq client (from CLI) is connected
[ ] Load/save items from/to a file (load and save actions)
[ ] Plugins for viewing different item mime types
    * create widget function
    * search regexp widget function
[ ] better cache for item delegate
    * similar to QCache
    * items can be inserted on given index
      (items after the new one are moved one index up)
    * items can be moved
    * combination of QList and QCache?
