bugs
- misses data sometimes when m_wnd->addToTab is done
  sometimes data is thrown away around mainwindow.cpp#1477. Not sure why..
- need to re-add command menu(s?) (QTBUG-31549, QTBUG-34160)
- tests fail (probably due to missing platform stuff??)

misc
- test build on cmake
- add docs on how to package app (make copyq.app) to the readme and hacking files
- everything in mac-platform
