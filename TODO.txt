bugs
- misses data sometimes when m_wnd->addToTab is done
  sometimes data is thrown away around mainwindow.cpp#1477. Not sure why..
- tests fail (probably due to missing platform stuff??)
- clicking the tray menu toggles the main window

misc
- test build on cmake
- add docs on how to package app (make copyq.app) to the readme and hacking files

macplatform:
- Find a way to get the current window title instead of the application title
