bugs
- misses data sometimes when m_wnd->addToTab is done
  sometimes data is thrown away around mainwindow.cpp#1477. Not sure why..
- tests fail (probably due to missing platform stuff??)
- using LSUIElement in the Info.plist makes the menu unusable in the GUI :(.
  May be able to work around this using some magic with
  NSApplicationActivationPolicy. If not, then will need to launch a separate
  process to show the main window (!!!), since we can "promote" an app from
  an "Accessory" to a "normal" app, but not vice-versa. As a temporary work
  around, we can try to add the menu directly to the app window instead of
  using the global menu..

misc
- test build on cmake
- add docs on how to package app (make copyq.app) to the readme and hacking files
- show in dock when main window up
- b&w themed icon?
- lots more testing!

macplatform:
- Find a way to get the current window title instead of the application title
